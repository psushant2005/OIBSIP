            Paul and Clara Jobs fulfilled their promise
            to Joanne Schieble by sending their son to
            Reed College in Portland, Ore., but Steve
            quickly rebelled against the liberal arts school,
            skipping his required classes and favoring
            dance classes instead. The structure, combined
            with the cost of tuition, pushed Jobs to drop out
            of Reed. However, he continued taking classes
            and credited his calligraphy course as the
            Reason the Mac had multiple typefaces and
            proportionally spaced fonts.
